# Overview
This folder contains all code used to produce figures in *Take it or leave it: influence of environmental and management variables on harvest and discard rates in a multispecies fishery; a case study with gag (Mycteroperca microlepis)*. 
Files are pulled directly from the online respositories of this paper and its companion paper, [Modeling effort in a multispecies recreational fishery; influence of species-specific temporal closures, relative abundance, and seasonality on monthly angler-trips](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2024.107136). [This R file](https://github.com/ChallenHymanPhD/Hyman-et-al-2024-Harvest/blob/R-Files/Hyman%20et%20al%202024%20Harvest%20All%20Analyses.R) will run each section of code with test annotations. Alternatively, you can download the complete [R markdown file](https://github.com/ChallenHymanPhD/Hyman-et-al-2024-Harvest/blob/R-Files/Hyman%20et%20al%202024%20Supplemental%20Code%20github.Rmd) (with all equations and detailed explanations) and run it to generate the requisite HTML file, or download the knitted HTML output directly [here](https://github.com/ChallenHymanPhD/Hyman-et-al-2024-Harvest/blob/R-Files/Hyman-et-al-2024-Supplemental-Code.html)
